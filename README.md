<h1 align="center">Frontend Mentor - Four Card Feature Section</h1>

- I created this landing page based on the [Frontend Mentor - Four Card Feature Section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK) design.

## Goals

- The challenge was to build out this page and make it look as close to the design as possible.
- The designs were in JPG static format. Meaning that I had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

## How to use it

- Download the files and open `index.html` on the browser.
